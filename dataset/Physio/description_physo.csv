Condition,Description
Lymphedema,"Lymphedema is a chronic condition where excess lymph fluid collects in tissues, causing swelling, usually in the arms or legs. It often occurs due to damage or removal of lymph nodes, commonly following cancer treatments."
Sport Injuries,"Sport injuries are physical injuries that occur during exercise or while participating in sports. They can involve the muscles, bones, ligaments, or tendons, and commonly include sprains, strains, fractures, and dislocations"
Muscular Dystrophy,"Muscular dystrophy refers to a group of genetic disorders that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass. Over time, affected muscles deteriorate, leading to difficulty in movement, breathing, and heart problems"
Back and Neck Pain,"Back and neck pain refers to discomfort or stiffness in the spinal region, which can be caused by poor posture, injury, overuse, or underlying medical conditions such as herniated discs or arthritis. These pains can limit mobility and interfere with daily activities"
Range of Motion (ROM),"Range of Motion (ROM) refers to the full movement potential of a joint, typically measured in degrees. It indicates how far a joint can move in various directions, such as flexion, extension, rotation, and abduction."
Osteoporosis,"Osteoporosis is a medical condition where bones become weak and brittle due to a loss of bone density. This increases the risk of fractures, especially in the hips, spine, and wrists. It often develops with aging, particularly in postmenopausal women, but can affect men as well"
Vertigo,"Vertigo is a sensation of spinning or dizziness, where a person feels as if they or their surroundings are moving, even when stationary. It is often caused by issues with the inner ear, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, or M�ni�re's disease"
Headache,"A headache is pain or discomfort in the head or upper neck. It can range from mild to severe and may be caused by various factors, including stress, dehydration, tension, sinus issues, or underlying medical conditions."
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome,"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a condition caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel in the wrist. This leads to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in the hand and fingers, especially the thumb, index, and middle fingers"
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is a complex disorder characterized by extreme, long-lasting fatigue that does not improve with rest and worsens with physical or mental activity."
Respiratory Issues (Chronic Bronchitis),"Chronic bronchitis is a long-term inflammation of the bronchial tubes, leading to persistent cough and production of mucus. It is one of the conditions included in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)."
Burns,"Burns are injuries to the skin or other tissues caused by heat, chemicals, electricity, friction, or radiation"
Joint Replacement,Joint replacement is a surgical procedure where a damaged or arthritic joint is removed and replaced with a prosthetic implant
Ankle Sprain,"An ankle sprain is an injury that occurs when the ligaments supporting the ankle are stretched or torn, typically due to rolling, twisting, or landing awkwardly on the foot. This injury is common in sports and can range from mild to severe"
Parkinsons Disease(Paralysis),"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects movement. It results from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, particularly in the substantia nigra, which plays a key role in coordinating movement. While it does not directly cause paralysis, it can lead to motor symptoms that significantly affect mobility and function."
Foot Fracture,"A foot fracture is a break in one or more of the bones in the foot, which can occur due to trauma, overuse, or underlying medical conditions that weaken bones"
Huntingtons Disease,"Huntington's disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the HTT gene, leading to the progressive degeneration of neurons in specific areas of the brain. It typically manifests in mid-adulthood but can appear at any age."
Knee Ligament Injuries,"Knee ligament injuries are common injuries that affect the ligaments supporting the knee joint, often resulting from sports, falls, or accidents"
Pelvic Floor Dysfunction,"Pelvic floor dysfunction refers to a range of conditions that occur when the pelvic floor muscles are weakened, overactive, or not functioning correctly. The pelvic floor is a group of muscles and ligaments that support the pelvic organs, including the bladder, uterus (in women), and rectum."
Cancer,"Cancer is a complex group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. It can arise in virtually any tissue or organ and is classified based on the type of cells involved, the location of the tumor"
